It's me, Sze Chia-Hao(史家豪), now a 12th grader with a focused interest in pure mathematics and math contests. If you got some funny problems or element ideas, just feel free to let me know! 

My studies extend beyond the standard secondary curriculum to include foundational topics in more abstract fields in my school era. In fact it really taught me the differences between so-called *consumers* and *producers*—that is to say, ones who package math as tools and skills, studying it to follow some existing rules, or as an architecture, seeing its beauty and analytical nature. More specifically, I'm more likely to dig *why* a statement is hold, rather than *what* they be. Maybe one day I am able to make really cool things.

This site serves as a repository for my mathematical techniques and explorations: expository notes on classical theorems, original solutions to competition problems (e.g., from the CMO/IMO), and reflections on proof strategies that reveal deeper structural insights. I aim to cultivate mathematical maturity through disciplined study, precise reasoning, and the habit of asking probing questions.

Hope you could enjoy yourself.
